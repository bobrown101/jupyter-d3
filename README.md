# GraphML to d3.js visualization utilities



## To start the project:
*Must have jupyter installed*
*Must have networkx installed*
*Must have community installed*
*Must have numpy installed*
*Must have scipy installed*

```
jupyter notebook    # this should be run at the root directory of this repo
```



the main file that I have been working on is force-directed-graph.ipynb

When you open it, you should get an alert saying that d3 was loaded.

 > I have read through the docs tirelessly, and it appears that there is occasionally
a bug that occurs that prevents d3 from being loaded. I have yet to figure out why.
So if you dont get that alert message, do a hard refresh of the page
(in chrome that would be CMD+SHIFT+R)

If you run through the notebook, below the very last cell you should find a
"Create Graph" button. If you click it, it will load a graph below it.
